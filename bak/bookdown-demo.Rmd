# Introduction

This is the main workbook for CSDE 502 for Winter 2021. It will contain or link to all lecture notes, code examples, exercises, and assignments. Assignment answer keys will be provided in a separate location accessible only to currently enrolled CSDE 502 students.

The course syllabus is available as a PDF: [csde502_syllabus_2021.pdf](csde502_syllabus_2021.pdf).

## Course logistics
### Class meetings
All class meetings will happen over Zoom. The Zoom link for this course is [https://washington.zoom.us/j/91024750420?pwd=SUtndHV6VGlUTHRsVTk2V2o4bXhMUT09](https://washington.zoom.us/j/91024750420?pwd=SUtndHV6VGlUTHRsVTk2V2o4bXhMUT09). Please join the class promptly at the scheduled time (Fridays at 10:30 AM). About halfway through the class session there will be a 10-minute break.

Class meetings will follow the structure:

1. Addressing any outstanding issues from previous sessions or assignments. 
1. A brief lecture to introduce the topics of the day.
1. A hands-on instructional session.
1. Overview/clarification of assignment.

### Computing
All computing for this course should be done on CSDE Terminal Server 4 ("TS4", csde-ts4.csde.washington.edu). Most students have computers capable of running R and handling relatively large data sets. However, using a common computing environment will help us avoid some of the problems associated with running the same code on different machines that have different processors, RAM, graphics cards, R versions, etc. This will aid in troubleshooting any problems that arise.

For information about the CSDE Terminal Servers, see [Choosing a Terminal  Server](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/resources/#TerminalServerChoosing). For instructions on connecting to a Terminal Server, see [Computing tutorials](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/tutorials/).

In order to make remote connections to TS4, you will need a remote desktop protocol (RDP) client. Windows has a built-in "Remote Desktop" application. The same is available for Macs at the Apple Store. Windows users may also want to use [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/), which I find to be a bit more full-featured than the built-in Windows application. Linux users are likely to have problems establishing stable RDP connections, although [Remmina](https://sourceforge.net/projects/remmina/) might work.

In addition to the RDP client, in order to access any of CSDE's computing resources, it is necessary to install and enable Husky OnNet, the UW virtual private network (VPN) client. Instructions are available at [Download and use Husky OnNet](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/use-husky-onnet/)

### Assignments
Each week there will be an assignment made available at 12:00 on the day of class meetings. The assignments are designed to allow students to practice the skills introduced in class sessions. Assignments are due at 09:00 AM on the week following when the assignment was distributed. See the [syllabus](csde502_syllabus_2021.pdf) for additional details.

# Week 1 {#week1}

## Getting started on Terminal Server 4
First, make sure you have the Husky OnNet VPN application running and have connected to the UW network. You should see the f5 icon in your task area:

If you are using the Windows Remote Desktop Prococol (RDP) connection, your connection parameters should look like this:

![](images/2021-01-07_21_48_03-Remote Desktop Connection.png)

If you are using mRemoteNG, the connection parameters will match this:

Once you are connected you should see a number of icons on the desktop and application shortcuts in the Start area.

Open a Windows Explorer (if you are running RDP in full screen mode you should be able to use the key combination Win-E).

Before doing anything, let's change some of the annoying default settings of the Windows Explorer. Tap `File > Options`. In the `View` tab, make sure that `Always show menus` is checked and `Hide extensions for known file types` is unchecked. The latter setting is very important because we want to see the complete file name for all files at all times.

Click `Apply to Folders` so that these settings become default. Click `Yes` to the next dialog.

Now let's make a folder for the files in this course.

Navigate to This PC:

![](images/2021-01-07_22_05_59-Window.png)

You should see the `H:` drive. This is is the mapped drive that links to your [U Drive](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/online-storage/u-drive-central-file-storage-for-users/), and is the place where all of the data for this course is to be stored. __Do not store any data on the `C:` drive!__ The `C:` drive can be wiped without any prior notification.

Navigate into `H:` and create a new folder named `csde502_winter_2021`. Note the use of lowercase letters and underscores rather than spaces. This will be discussed in the section on file systems later in this lesson.
